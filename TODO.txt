Pairing:
1) problem in  assigning id whenever i will close the server the id will start from one so we need a mechanism to solve that problem.
2) while editing task or subtask for wrong spelling it is showing error we don't want that underline so we have to remove that line.
3) Want to add some space between edit icon and delete icon.
4) give style of h2 tag of class body header in css file
6) delete tags class like p,ul, li and merge with div classes.
